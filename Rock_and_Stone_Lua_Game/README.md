   ```

## üåê Multiplayer Setup

### Hosting a Game

1. **Launch as Host**:
   ```bash
   lovr . --mode=host --port=6789
   ```
   Or modify the game code to set `multiplayerMode = "host"`

2. **Configure Network**:
   - Default port: `6789`
   - Ensure firewall allows incoming connections on your chosen port
   - Share your public IP address with players who want to join

3. **Port Forwarding** (if needed):
   - Forward the game port (default 6789) in your router settings
   - Use tools like UPnP if supported by your router

### Joining a Game

1. **Launch as Client**:
   ```bash
   lovr . --mode=client --host=<SERVER_IP> --port=6789
   ```
   Or modify the game code to set:
   ```lua
   multiplayerMode = "client"
   serverAddress = "SERVER_IP_HERE"
   serverPort = 6789
   ```

2. **Connection Process**:
   - The game will automatically attempt to connect to the specified server
   - Wait for "Connected to server!" message
   - You'll be assigned a unique player ID

### Single Player Mode

Launch without any multiplayer parameters:
```bash
lovr .
```

- **Jump**: `Space` bar
- **Interact**: Mouse clicks for interactions
- **Exit**: `Escape` key

### VR Mode

- **Interaction**: Hand tracking and controller buttons
- **Grabbing**: Grip buttons to interact with objects
- **Menu**: Menu button for game options

## üîß Configuration

### Network Settings
Edit these variables in `main.lua`:
```lua
local serverAddress = "localhost"  -- Server IP address
local serverPort = 6789           -- Server port
local multiplayerMode = "single"  -- "host", "client", or "single"
```

### Physics Parameters
```lua
local playerJumpForce = 1000      -- Jump strength
local playerNPCSpeed = 1200       -- Player movement speed
local npcSpeedLimit = 15          -- NPC maximum speed
```

### Graphics Settings
```lua
local shadow_map_size = 4096      -- Shadow quality (higher = better quality)
local light_intensity = 1        -- Lighting strength
local debug_show_shadow_map = false -- Debug shadow rendering
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**"Failed to create ENet host"**
- Ensure ENet library is properly installed
- Check that the port isn't already in use
- Try running as administrator (Windows)

**"Failed to connect to server"**
- Verify server IP address and port
- Check firewall settings on both client and server
- Ensure host is running and accepting connections

**"Connection timeout"**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify port forwarding configuration
- Try connecting locally first (127.0.0.1)

### Performance Issues

**Low FPS**
- Reduce `shadow_map_size` in configuration
- Disable VR mode if not needed
- Close other applications

**Network Lag**
- Check ping with the ping command in-game
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Host should have good upload speed

### VR-Specific Issues

**Tracking Problems**
- Ensure adequate lighting in play space
- Check VR headset setup and calibration
- Verify controllers are charged and paired

**Motion Sickness**
- Use teleportation locomotion instead of smooth movement
- Take frequent breaks
- Adjust comfort settings in VR software

## üåê Network Architecture

### Client-Server Model
- **Host Authority**: The host controls all NPCs and physics simulation
- **Client Prediction**: Clients predict their own movement for responsiveness
- **State Synchronization**: Regular updates ensure all clients stay in sync

### Message Types
- **PLAYER_UPDATE**: Position and rotation data (sent frequently)
- **NPC_UPDATE**: NPC state and physics data (host only)
- **NPC_PUSH**: Client notifications of NPC interactions
- **JOIN_GAME**: Initial connection and player setup
- **PING**: Network latency measurement

### Network Optimization
- **Unreliable Updates**: Position data uses UDP for speed
- **Reliable Messages**: Important events use TCP for accuracy
- **Compression**: Efficient data formatting reduces bandwidth

## üîç Advanced Features

### Developer Tools
- **Debug Rendering**: Enable debug modes for troubleshooting
- **Console Output**: Detailed logging for development
- **Physics Visualization**: See collision boundaries and forces

### Modding Support
- **Lua Scripting**: Easily modify game behavior
- **Asset Loading**: Support for custom models and textures
- **Configuration Files**: Extensive customization options

## üìã Server Management

### Hosting Best Practices
1. **Stable Connection**: Use wired internet connection
2. **Port Management**: Keep firewall rules updated
3. **Player Limits**: Monitor performance with multiple players
4. **Regular Backups**: Save game states if persistence is added

### Monitoring
- Check console output for connection status
- Monitor ping times for all connected players
- Watch for physics simulation issues
